  "decompose_steps": "Let’s break this down into clear, ordered steps:\n\n1. **Identify key timeline events:**  \n   - Battle starts 100 years ago from the “present” (start of story) and lasts 10 days.  \n   - Alex arrives in the past 3 days before battle starts.  \n\n2. **Calculate initial stay before jump:**  \n   - He arrives 3 days before battle starts.  \n   - He stays for 6 days total in this period.  \n   - Determine how many days of battle he has seen by the end of this initial stay.  \n\n3. **Apply the forward time jump:**  \n   - After 6 days in the past, he jumps forward in time by 50 years.  \n   - This means he leaves his initial time period and arrives 50 years later.  \n   - Determine the new calendar date relative to the original battle.  \n\n4. **Account for the second stay before going back to battle:**  \n   - He stays in this new time (50 years after his arrival date in the past) for 20 days.  \n\n5. **Travel back to witness the end of the battle:**  \n   - From the new time, he travels back to the exact date when the battle ends.  \n   - Determine the total elapsed time Alex experiences from arrival to witnessing battle end.  \n\n6. **Calculate total days Alex spends in the past before seeing battle end:**  \n   - Combine initial stay, second stay, and any final travel/duration after returning to battle time.",
  "calculate_steps": "Alright, let's follow the steps as listed.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 – Identify key timeline events**  \n- Battle starts at **day 0** relative to battle timeline (negative days before battle).  \n- Battle lasts 10 days → battle ends at day 10 of battle time.  \n- Alex arrives **3 days before battle starts**, so arrival day in battle timeline = **day –3**.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 – Calculate initial stay before jump**  \nHe stays for **6 days** in this initial period, from day –3 to day –3 + 6 = **day +3** of battle timeline.  \nSo at the moment before jump: it’s day +3 of battle (battle is ongoing; it started at day 0 and will end day 10).  \nDays of battle he has seen by now: from day 0 to day 3 → **3 days** of battle seen.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 – Apply the forward time jump**  \nJumps forward in time by **50 years** (calendar time, not just days) from day +3 battle timeline.  \nSince the battle was 100 years ago from Alex’s original “present”, jumping forward 50 years means:  \nNew calendar date is now **50 years after original arrival date**.  \nThat means in battle timeline:  \nOriginally battle took place in year Y (say year –100 from “present”). Alex arrives in Y–3 days.  \nAfter initial 6 days: calendar year Y + 3 days.  \nJump forward 50 years: calendar year (Y + 50) + 3 days.  \n\nIn **battle time units**: battle year = Y.  \nNow in year Y + 50, day number within year = same as day +3 in year Y.  \nBut battle ended in year Y, day 10.  \nSo Alex is now in a time **50 years after** the battle’s date, not during the battle.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 – Account for second stay before going back to battle**  \nStays in this new time (year Y + 50, day +3) for 20 days.  \nSo in year Y + 50, from day +3 to day +23 of that year.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 – Travel back to witness the end of battle**  \nHe travels back from (Y + 50, day +23) to (Y, day 10).  \nThat’s a jump back exactly 50 years and (day +23 to day 10 = –13 days adjustment). But since years differ, easier to note:  \nHe’s exactly 50 years + 13 days **past** battle end date? Wait, check:  \n\nBattle end: year Y, day 10.  \nAlex’s time before final jump: year Y+50, day 23.  \nDifference: 50 years and (day 23 – day 10) = 13 days later than battle end, **in absolute calendar**.  \nSo to go to battle end, he must jump **back 50 years and back 13 days**.  \n\nOnce he jumps: he arrives at battle end **instantly**, not spending extra days in travel.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 – Calculate total days Alex spends in the past before seeing battle end**  \n\nDays spent in past phases (excluding final travel time):  \n\n1. Initial stay in past: **6 days**  \n2. Second stay in past (still in the past, just 50 years later): **20 days**  \n\nTotal = 6 + 20 = **26 days**.  \n\nHe sees battle end **after** these 26 days of being in the past (in both time periods).  \nThen he can return to present or elsewhere, but the question asks: *How many days does Alex spend in the past before he sees the end of the battle?*  \nAnswer: **26 days**.\n\n---\n\n**Final step output for each step:**  \n\nStep 1: Battle timeline: arrival day = –3, battle days 0 to 10.  \nStep 2: Initial stay: 6 days → at battle day +3 before jump. Seen 3 days of battle.  \nStep 3: Jump forward 50 years from battle day +3 → now in year Y+50, same day-of-year as day +3.  \nStep 4: Stays 20 days → now year Y+50, day 23.  \nStep 5: Travel back to year Y, day 10 (battle end).  \nStep 6: Total days spent in past before seeing battle end: **26 days**.",

  "statement": "In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides to go back in time to witness a famous historical battle that took place 100 years ago, which lasted for 10 days. He arrives three days before the battle starts. However, after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time by 50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he travels back to witness the end of the battle. How many days does Alex spend in the past before he sees the end of the battle?"
