Based on your request for time travel and fantasy movies, and specifically excluding romance and romantic comedies, here are three excellent recommendations:\n\n### 1. **Avengers: Endgame** (2019)\n\n*   **Genre:** Superhero, Action, Sci-Fi/Fantasy\n*   **Why it fits your request:** This is the quintessential blockbuster that masterfully blends high-concept sci-fi time travel with epic superhero fantasy. The plot revolves around the remaining Avengers devising a \"time heist\" to travel into the past of their own universe to collect the Infinity Stones and undo the catastrophic events of the previous film. The focus is squarely on action, adventure, teamwork, and redemption, with no central romantic plotline driving the narrative.\n\n### 2. **Army of Darkness** (1992)\n\n*   **Genre:** Horror Fantasy, Comedy, Action\n*   **Why it fits your request:** This cult classic is a wild, campy ride. The protagonist, Ash Williams, is a modern-day chainsaw-handed store clerk who is accidentally transported back to the Middle Ages. There, he must battle an army of undead \"Deadites\" to find his way back home. The film is a fantastical blend of horror",
