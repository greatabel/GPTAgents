Based on your request for movies with the subjects of time travel and fantasy, while excluding romantic comedies and the romance genre, here are three excellent recommendations:\n\n### 1. **The Time Machine (2002)**\n*   **Subject:** Time Travel\n*   **Genre:** Fantasy, Adventure, Sci-Fi\n*   **Why it fits:** This is a classic fantasy adventure based on H.G. Wells's novel. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel far into the future, where he discovers a divided society on a post-apocalyptic Earth. It's driven by a quest for answers and survival, with no central romantic comedy plot.\n\n### 2. **Looper (2012)**\n*   **Subject:** Time Travel\n*   **Genre:** Sci-Fi, Action, Thriller, Fantasy\n*   **Why it fits:** While grounded in a gritty sci-fi reality, the film's core conflict has a strong, almost supernatural fantasy element, especially as the story unfolds. It's a high-stakes, violent, and mind-bending thriller about assassins whose targets are sent back in time from the future. The focus is on action and its complex moral dilemmas, not romance.\n\n### 3. **Army",
